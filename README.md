# traine
Source code for html typescript multiplayer sandbox game along with many usefull scripts used to create what's in there.

Developing an open world game for a browser that works on multiple devices is really time consuming and requires a lot more extra work than if aiming for a specific platfom.
I decided to use Babylonjs since it's the most abstract and flexible engine available (with upcomming support for webGPU).

Note:
A lot of gameplay and envoirnmental features features are yet to be implemented.
This is in no way code in it's final state.
